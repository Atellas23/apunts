"""From this graph, we can estimate the formant and fundamental frequencies:
- The fundamental frequency is calculated dividing the sampling frequency by the period of the signal. In our case, the period is $P=75$ and the sampling frequency is $f_s=8000$. Then,
$$
  f_f=\dfrac{f_s}{P}=\dfrac{8000}{75}\approx 107\text{ Hz}.
$$
So, the speaker is (unsurprisingly, as we already knew) more likely to be a man.
- The formant frequencies are the two most important peaks times the sampling frequency; the most important formant is clearly $f_1=f_s\cdot0.0932...\approx 745.6\text{ Hz}$, and the second formant is $f_2=f_s\cdot0.1587...\approx1269.6\text{ Hz}$. We can conclude that we have found an 'A'.

We can also study one period of the 'A' signal, where the formant peaks are more clearly distinguishable:

"""Now, the formant frequencies can be more clearly calculated, as the two most prominent peaks are at $0.0879$ and at $0.1558$, so the formants are $f_1=8000\cdot0.0879\approx703.2$ and $f_2=8000\cdot0.1558\approx1246.4$.
