#### 1. Introduction

##### Stochastic Processes

When we have a set of signals that can be analyzed as being the result of the same given experiment, we model these signals as a **stochastic process** to jointly study them.

##### Memoryless Processes

The analysis of a stochastic process relies on the **<span style='color:blue'>statistic</span>** of the samples and on the **<span style='color:blue'>dependencies</span>** among samples. **Memoryless processes** assume that every sample of the process is **<span style='color:blue'>independent</span>** of its neighbor samples.

Any **processing of memoryless processes** only takes into account the sample values (**<span style='color:blue'>sample-wise operators</span>**), but not their index (time instant or position) of their neighbor samples' values. This are non-linear operations, defined by a mapping function, they process in the same way all samples with the same value and are commonly used for **<span style='color:blue'>perceptual purposes</span>**.

##### Image model

Sample-wise operators are largely used in **image processing**; in the **<span style='color:blue'>pixel-based image model</span>**, for example, the image is understood as a collection of independent pixels. Operations also only take into account the pixel values, manipulating equally every pixel with the same value. **Pixel-based image operators** are defined as following:

- In a generic way, without taking into account the specificity of the images. These are called **range transform operators**.
- In a specific way, adapting the operator to the image pixels' statistics. These are called **histogram-based operators**.

##### Memoryless operators

These operators are very fast since they only require accessing at the pixel value of the pixel being processed. They are **memoryless** since they don't require storing any neighbor pixel values.

Other image models require analyzing a neighborhood of the pixel being processed: space-frequency data, geometrical data, region-based models... We will analyze the two main types of memoryless operators introduced before.

#### 2. Generic operators

##### Range Transform Operators

We define a transformation $T(\cdot)$ on the range of values of the input image ($r$) onto the range of values of the output image ($s$).

###### Gray level mapping

Different segments of the input gray-level range are **<span style='color:blue'>expanded or compressed</span>** depending on the transform features. The segments of $r$ where the magnitude of the derivative of $T(r)$ is greater than 1 are expanded, and the segments where it's smaller than 1 are compressed.

###### Contrast mapping

It expands (stretches) a range of the input image, mapping it into the whole output image range. A set of values of $r$ are mapped into a single value of $s$, a process called **clipping**.

Typically, clipping happens between the ends of the $r$ range and the ends of the $s$ range, mapping the minimum onto the minimum and the maximum onto the maximum. As a consequence of clipping, contrast mapping is a non-reversible transform (it's not injective).

###### Negative mapping

It inverts the range of values of the input image creating a negative version of it. This does not change the contrast of the image. The difference between two pixels remains the same, and the magnitude of the derivative of $T$ is always 1.

###### Binarization mapping

It binarizes the image by clipping all values below a threshold to 0 and all values above to 1. This is also commonly known as thresholding, and is non-reversible because of clipping.

###### Log transformation

It is mainly used to compress the dynamic range of the image.

###### Power-law

Also known as *gamma correction*, this was originally developed for correcting Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) distortion. It's useful to implement the Stevens power law for brightness perception.

###### Pseudo color

The input range is mapped onto a higher dimensional space; for example, a 3D space representing a color space, where a color ($s$) is assigned to every grey level value ($r$). The transform can be represented by means of a Look-Up Table (LUT) that puts in correspondence the input and output values.

It's commonly used for visualization purposes in arts and biomedical applications. In satellite imagery, for example, spectral indexes are combinations between bands to obtain a parameter of interest.

##### Implementation

Let us assume we want to implement $s=T(r)=\log(r+1)$. A possible approach is to compute the transform sample by sample:

```c++
// Transform the image
for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) y[i][j] = log(x[i][j] + 1);
}
```

But the resulting image has only 256 possible different values. So, we improve the implementation using dynamic programming:

```c++
// Build the LUT
for (int k = 0; k < Max_Val; ++k) LUT[k] = log(k + 1);

// Transform the image using the LUT
for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) y[i][j] = LUT(x[i][j]);
}
```

This replaces runtime computation with simple array indexing operations.
