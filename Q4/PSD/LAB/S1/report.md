# Session 1: Remembering Linux
As stated in the Lab statement, these are the commands used in the first laboratory session of the course:
- `ssh`: this stands for "Secure Shell". It's a Unix command-line app used to connect two computers on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol over an unprotected network (or at least, without enough security as one of the ends of the connection desires).
- `scp`: this is a version of the `cp` command, and stands for "Secure Copy". It copies files between two computers using the SSH protocol in a secure way.
- `pwd`: this command stands for "print working directory", and it does just that.
- `ls`: this command prints the contents of the current directory, and with the `-l` flag, it also prints out the file permissions for the different computer users.
- `cp`: this command copies the files/directories in the first argument to the directory specified in the second argument.
- `tar`:  this command compresses and uncompresses (depending on the flags specified) the files passed as argument into another file, which name is also passed as an argument.
- `mkdir`: creates a directory with the name passed as an argument.
- `cd`: changes the current directory to the one passed as an argument.
- `echo`: writes in the standard output the string passed as an argument.
- `export`: changes the value of an environment variable.
- `chmod`: modifies the permissions of the different users of the computer to the ones specified as an argument.
- `alias`/`unalias`: creates/removes an alias, a different name defined for a command; usually used to create command shortcuts.
- `grep`: searches for lines that contain a given pattern in a given file.
- `time`: analyzes the real, user and program time a process takes to stop.
- `ps`: displays information about a selection of processes (`man ps`).
- `cat`: displays the content of a file as if it were plaintext.
