Exercise 1

We can get the information we need both from executing `lscpu` or `cat /proc/cpuinfo`, but it is easier to read in the former. The information we are asked for is:
- Model of the processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700
- Number of cores: 4
- Number of threads/core: 2
- Frequency of the processor: 3.40 GHz
- Byte order: Little Endian
----------

Exercise 2

The computer controls the PCI ports with an Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v5/E3-1500 v5/6th Gen Core Processor PCIe Controller (x16). It has 3 PCI slots, and these are:
- PCI 10de:1287: NVIDIA Corporation GK208B [GeForce GT 730]
- PCI 8086:a282: Intel Corporation 200 Series PCH SATA controller [AHCI mode]
- PCI 8086:15e3: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection (5) I219-LM
----------

Exercise 3

I have found these levels:
- L1: this is memory per core, and is divided into two separate types:
	- L1i: only-instruction memory (32kB)
	- L1d: only-data memory (32kB)
- L2: this is also memory per core, and it is not divided. It has 256kB of memory, devoted both to data and instructions.
- L3: this is memory shared between all cores, and it is not divided. It has 8192kB of memory, devoted both to data and instructions.
----------

Exercise 4

If we run `numactl -H`, the output is
```
available: 1 nodes (0)
node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
node 0 size: 15952 MB
node 0 free: 12494 MB
node distances:
node   0 
  0:  10 
```
This system has one sole memory node, with a size of 15952MB. Of this memory, 12494MB are free.
----------

Exercise 5

This system has the following USB devices:
- Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
- Bus 001 Device 003: ID 04f2:1469 Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd 
- Bus 001 Device 002: ID 03f0:094a Hewlett-Packard Optical Mouse [672662-001]
- Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
The two "root hub" devices are internal USB ports that serve as a hub for all the other ports. If we run `lsusb -v` and go to their entry, we can see that in the `bInterfaceClass` there is the word "Hub".
----------

Exercise 6

The lab systems have the following filesystems
```
Filesystem                          Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs                            8.4G     0  8.4G   0% /dev

Exercise 7

The command to compile all of them at once is `make`.
----------

Exercise 8
a) `./launch.sh i ./integers`, where `i` is any numer from 0 to the number of processors (not included).
b) The elapsed time is 12.96s, and it has used 99%CPU.
c) `./launch.sh i ./floats`, where `i` is any numer from 0 to the number of processors (not included).
d) The elapsed time is 12.89s, and it has used 99%CPU.
e) `./launch.sh i ./mems`, where `i` is any numer from 0 to the number of processors (not included).
f) The elapsed time is 23.93s, and it has used 99%CPU.
----------

From this exercise on, the exercises where run in my personal laptop, with 6 cores with 2 threads each.

Exercise 9

- `./integers`
a) `./launch.sh 0 ./integers 2 ./integers`.
b) The average elapsed time is 45.625s and the average %CPU used is 97.5%.

-`./floats`
a) `./launch.sh 0 ./floats 2 ./floats`.
b) The average elapsed time is 43.695s and the average %CPU used is 99%.

-`./mems`
a) `./launch.sh 0 ./mems 2 ./mems`.
b) The average elapsed time is 1min 11.395s and the average %CPU used is 99%.

Running the same process in different PUs obviously has some impact on the elapsed time. It is far greater in this case than before. But, the %CPU used is almost the same.
----------

Exercise 10

- `./integers`
a) `./launch.sh 0 ./integers 1 ./integers`.
b) The average elapsed time is 43.09s and the average %CPU used is 97.5%.

-`./floats`
a) `./launch.sh 0 ./floats 1 ./floats`.
b) The average elapsed time is 43.695s and the average %CPU used is 99%.

-`./mems`
a) `./launch.sh 0 ./mems 1 ./mems`.
b) The average elapsed time is 1min 11.395s and the average %CPU used is 99%.

Running the same process in different PUs obviously has some impact on the elapsed time. It is far greater in this case than before. But, the %CPU used is almost the same.
