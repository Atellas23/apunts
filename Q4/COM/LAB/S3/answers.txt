Exercise 1

To make the code run properly, we have to include the libraries `stdio.h` for the function `sprintf` and `unistd.h` for the function `write`. The numbers in the `man` calls are the manual page that we want if the instruction asked for has for multiple entries in the Linux manual.

Exercise 2

The modified `Makefile` is:
```
all: hello hello2u

hello: hello.cc
	g++ -o hello hello.cc

hello2u:
	g++ -o hello2u hello2u.cc

clean:
	rm -f hello hello2u
```
