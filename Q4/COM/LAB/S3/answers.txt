Exercise 1

To make the code run properly, we have to include the libraries `stdio.h` for the function `sprintf` and `unistd.h` for the function `write`. The numbers in the `man` calls are the manual page that we want if the instruction asked for has for multiple entries in the Linux manual.
----------

Exercise 2

The modified `Makefile` is:
```
all: hello hello2u

hello: hello.cc
	g++ -Wall -o hello hello.cc

hello2u:
	g++ -Wall -o hello2u hello2u.cc

clean:
	rm -f hello hello2u
```
----------

Exercise 3

The file `hello2uchars.cc` is included in the zipped file.
----------

Exercise 4

The `utf16` executable shows in the standard output all the Unicode characters that the machine can write and recognize. But, some of these are à¡ž, blank characters.
`utf16-in-c` shows the same table, and also the sizes of the types `UChar` and `UChar32`.
`is` prints information about every character in the Unicode standard: in particular, it has information about if a character is defined, if it can be printed, if it is a control character, if it is blank, it it is a digit and if it is graphical.
----------

Exercise 5

The file `integers.cc` is included in the zipped file.
----------

Exercise 6

When, for example, we run `./integers 16 > num.dat && xxd num.dat` the output line is
```
00000000: 1000 0000                                ....
```
Knowing, as we do, that 16 in hexadecimal is 0010, this system must be little-endian.
----------

Exercise 7

Running `./integers $((0x0a0aa0c3))`, we can see that the output of the program is a character; in particular, the program writes the character 'à' to the terminal.
----------

Exercise 8

When we run `inttrunc` with the different values, we get
```
./inttrunc 27   ---> b
./inttrunc 250  ---> , fa
./inttrunc 258  ---> , 102
./inttrunc 1234 ---> , 4d2
```
----------

Exercise 9

The file `floatdiv.cc` is included in the zipped file. If we run `./floatdiv 1 10 > num.dat && xxd num.dat`, the result is
```
00000000: cdcc cc3d                                ...=
```
----------

Exercise 10

When we run `./ages Alex 21 Manel 41 Pep 23`, the output is
```
person 0:  Alex  21
person 1:  Manel  41
person 2:  Pep  23
```
----------

Exercise 11

When we run `./valsfp32`, the output is very similar to slide 20 of the second lesson of the course. In fact, here we have the decimal representation (or the name) of every number that appears in slide 20, and its binary representation as well. Running `./valsfp64`, a similar output appears; the difference between `valsfp32` and `valsfp64` is just the number of bits used to represent numbers, 32 and 64 respectively.
