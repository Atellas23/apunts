Exercise 1

/usr/bin/time and time report different time measures, though quite similar. The times reported by the application, when summed up agree with the elapsed time approximately.
If we now select the transpose ACCESS(i,j), the timings look less similar in usr and sys, but agree in real/elapsed. Again, when summing up the times reported by the application, they do somewhat agree with the elapsed/real time value.

Exercise 2

In initmat.cpp, I added the line #include "rusage.h" at the beggining and the following lines at the beggining and the end of the main function:
```
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   struct rusage r;
   int res_init = get_resource_usage(&r);
   ...
   int res_fini = get_resource_usage(&r);
   return 0;
}
```
The Makefile entry for initmat was subsequently modified to include rusage.cpp:
```
initmat: initmat.cpp
	g++ -fopt-info -fopenmp -g -O3 -o initmat initmat.cpp rusage.cpp
```
