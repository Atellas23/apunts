### Exercise 1

We continue with our script example: regression of a 1D function

We are interested in studying the influence of **sample size** on the fit.
The idea is that you embed the code in the script into a couple of handy functions and leave
the learning sample size $N$ as a parameter.

These are the learning sample sizes you are going to study

```{r}
Ns <- c(25,50,100,200,500)
```


You are asked to report the chosen lambda and the final test error (on the same test set),
plot the learned function against the data and the true generating function and see if the fit
is better/worse/equal as a function of $N$ and in what sense it is better/worse/equal.

Your code starts here ...
